I picked up a Google Chromecast with Google TV player and I was surprised that there was no official way to play xCloud games as the official app that could be sideloaded stopped working. As a software engineer, I decided to have a go at making a Google TV (Formally Android TV) app that would allow xCloud to play in full screen with controller support.

- [X] Remembers sign in

- [X] 🆕 Now launch from channel icon!
